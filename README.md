## Architecture Overview

The system is designed as a multi-tenant SaaS application with the following key features:

- **Multi-tenant isolation**: Each organization's data is completely isolated using Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Scalable design**: Supports organizations from small agencies to large enterprises
- **AI-powered matching**: Stores AI-generated match scores and recommendations
- **File management**: Handles CV/resume file storage and processing
- **Role-based access**: Different user roles (admin, recruiter, viewer) with appropriate permissions

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Supabase project set up
- Database access with appropriate permissions


### Option 2: Full Production Deployment

For production use with proper authentication:

#### Step 1: Run Migrations from folders mentioned by copying the files in order and running it in supabase table

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor or via CLI
\i migrations/001_create_tables.sql
\i migrations/002_create_subscription_table.sql
\i migrations/003_create_rls_policies.sql
```

#### Step 2: Create Auth Users

Choose one of these methods:

**Method A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
2. Create users with the UUIDs from the seed files
3. Set appropriate email addresses and passwords

**Method B: Using SQL (Requires elevated permissions)**
```sql
-- Run the auth users creation script
\i seed/001_create_auth_users.sql
```

#### Step 3: Seed Sample Data

```sql
-- Run seed files in order
\i seed/002_seed_organizations.sql
\i seed/003_seed_users.sql
\i seed/004_seed_jobs_candidates.sql
\i seed/005_seed_subscription_plans.sql

```


This will run everything in the correct order with proper error handling.

### Step 4: Test the Setup

Verify the setup by running some test queries:

```sql
-- Test organization isolation
SELECT * FROM organizations;

-- Test user profiles
SELECT up.*, o.name as organization_name 
FROM user_profiles up 
JOIN organizations o ON up.organization_id = o.id;

-- Test match results
SELECT 
    j.title as job_title,
    c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name as candidate_name,
    mr.match_score,
    mr.ai_summary
FROM match_results mr
JOIN jobs j ON mr.job_id = j.id
JOIN candidates c ON mr.candidate_id = c.id
ORDER BY mr.match_score DESC;
```

### Expected Output:
```
Rank | Candidate Name    | Score | Rating    | AI Summary
-----|------------------|-------|-----------|------------------
1    | Alice Martinez   | 92.5  | üåü Excellent | Strong React and Node.js experience...
2    | Bob Thompson     | 78.0  | ‚úÖ Good      | Good DevOps skills but limited frontend...
3    | Carol White      | 95.0  | üåü Excellent | Perfect match for DevOps role...
4    | More...          | 0.0.. | üåü Excellent | Perfect match for role...
```
## üîí Security Model

### Row Level Security (RLS)

The system implements comprehensive RLS policies to ensure complete data isolation between organizations:

- **Organization Isolation**: Users can only access data from their own organization
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for admins, recruiters, and viewers
- **Helper Functions**: Secure functions to get user organization and role information
- **Audit Functions**: Organization statistics and reporting functions


## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Tables

1. **organizations** - Multi-tenant root table
   - Stores company information and subscription details
   - Each organization has its own data isolation

2. **user_profiles** - User management
   - Extends Supabase auth.users
   - Links users to their organization
   - Role-based permissions (admin, recruiter, viewer)

3. **jobs** - Job postings
   - Job descriptions and requirements
   - Status tracking (draft, active, paused, closed)
   - Salary and location information

4. **candidates** - Candidate information
   - Personal details and contact information
   - Source tracking (LinkedIn, Indeed, referral, etc.)

5. **resumes** - CV/Resume files
   - File storage metadata
   - Text extraction for AI processing
   - Deduplication using content hashing

6. **match_results** - AI matching results

### Key Security Features

1. **Multi-tenant Isolation**: Complete data separation between organizations
2. **Role-based Permissions**: Granular access control based on user roles
3. **Secure Functions**: Helper functions with SECURITY DEFINER for safe access
4. **Audit Logging**: Built-in tracking of data changes and access
